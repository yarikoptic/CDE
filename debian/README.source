cde for Debian
--------------

CDE is packaged directly from the upstream's GIT repository.  Exclusion of
unncessary for source distribution materials (e.g. tarballs of pristine strace)
are handled via debian/source/options and .gitattributes, so that .orig.tar.gz
is generated by git-buildpackage or get-orig-source debian/rules directive.
