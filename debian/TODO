* manpages

  Ask Philip to
  - add handling of --help and --version

  - assure ok appearance processed with help2man (or just
    generate/maintain them)

  So far tried with

   help2man --no-info --help-option=-h ./cde --version-string=VERSION

* What is optimal way to run unit tests and what would be the
   build-depends to assure all necessary components for them
